## Technical Details

This calculator project is built using HTML5 and CSS3. The HTML code contains the structure of the calculator, which consists of buttons for input and output fields. The CSS code is responsible for the styling of the calculator, including the button layout and color scheme.

In addition, the calculator uses JavaScript to perform the arithmetic operations. The JavaScript code is embedded within the HTML file and handles the logic for calculating the result based on the user input.
